## Education

### Doctoral student
**Sept. 2013 – present** Aalto University, Department Computer Science and Engineering

My thesis topics include automated testing methods for sequential and concurrent
software, and applications of symbolic automata and transducers to optimizing
stream computations.

### M.Sc. in Computer Science
**Sept. 2011 – Aug. 2013** Aalto University, Department of Information and Computer Science

### B.Sc. in Computer Science
**Sept. 2007 – Apr. 2011** Helsinki University, Department of Computer Science

### Päivölä High School of Mathematics
**July 2004 – May 2006**

During this I had the opportunity to work at Nokia Research Center,
thanks to a partnership between Nokia and the school. See the Work
Experience section for details.

## Work Experience

### Aalto University
**1 Sept. 2013 – present** Doctoral student at the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering

See the Education section for details.

**1 June 2010 – 31 Aug. 2013** Research assistant at the Department of
Information and Computer Science

I worked on projects researching automated software testing
and verification. I extended the dynamic symbolic execution tool LCT to
support testing multithreaded Java programs. I also implemented a
dynamic partial order reduction algorithm and we published the
improvements I made in the paper “Improving Dynamic Partial Order
Reductions for Concolic Testing”. For my Master’s Thesis I implemented
the Dash algorithm for testing C programs.

From the summer of 2012 onwards I was employed full time. During previous
teaching periods I was employed part time, 1 day per week, while
the summers were full time.

### Microsoft Research

**6 June 2016 - 9 Sept. 2016** Research intern

I integrated a code generator for string matchers into the Scope query language
for Microsoft's internal Cosmos big data platform. The code generator used
symbolic automata enable minimization and composition of string matchers. On a
popular set of regex benchmarks the code generator was 1.1X faster than Google's
RE2 regex engine.

**2 Feb. 2015 - 8 May 2015** Research intern

Interning under Margus Veanes I developed a tool that allows users to specify
symbolic transducers as imperative C# code, fuses compositions of symbolic
transducers and finally generates efficient C# that shows significant speedups
over modular hand-written and LINQ implementations. We developed a fusion
procedure that uses an SMT solver and reachability analysis to make fusing
larger compositions feasible.

### Helsinki University of Technology
**1 June 2009 – 31 Aug. 2009** Research assistant at the Laboratory for
Theoretical Computer Science

I worked on a project researching formal methods and automated testing.
I developed a set of utilities to generate test drivers for the
automated testing tool LCT and unit tests from the output of the testing
tool. I also designed and implemented a heuristic for directed testing.

### Optofidelity Ltd.

**17 June 2008 – 29 June 2008** 36 hours of work on a one-off project.

I built a sound capture component for a visual programming environment.

**5 June 2007 – 24 Aug. 2007** Trainee

My main project was a technology demo that used a PTZ camera and a
machine vision library to track a printed target and read a handwritten
phone number from it.

### Nokia Research Center

**26 June 2006 – 28 July 2006** Full time trainee  
**12 Aug. 2005 – 31 May 2006** Part time trainee, 12 hours/week  
**1 June 2005 – 11 Aug. 2005** Full time trainee  
**1 Sept. 2004 – 31 May 2005** Part time trainee, 12 hours/week  

The work was software development for internal projects. Two of my
projects were concept demos on using image analysis techniques to
generate content in games. One project was a technology demo for a
mobile multiplayer gaming framework.

This traineeship was part of my education at the Päivölä High School of
Mathematics.

## Conferences and Schools

Attended the 2016 European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS 2016) and presented our [SV-COMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/)
contribution: *LCTD: Tests-guided proofs for C programs on LLVM (competition
contribution)*.

Attended the 4th Halmstad Summer School on Testing (HSST 2014).

Attended the 25th Nordic Workshop on Programming Theory (NWPT 2013) and
gave a talk titled *LCT-D: Test-Guided Proofs for C Programs on LLVM*.

Attended Summer School Marktoberdorf 2013 (MOD 2013) on software systems
safety.

Attended the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated
Software Engineering (ASE 2012).

Attended the 12th International Conference on Application of Concurrency
to System Design (ACSD 2012) to present the paper *Improving Dynamic
Partial Order Reductions for Concolic Testing*.

## Awards and Honours

I was selected to the *Honours Programme in Information and Computer
Science* at Aalto University for the academic years 2011–2012 and
2012–2013.

*Meritorious Winner in the COMAP MCM: Mathematical Contest in
Modeling* in 2006 with Olli Salli and Matti Nelimarkka.

*Meritorious Winner in the COMAP ICM: Interdisciplinary Contest in
Modeling* in 2005 with Vihtori Mäntylä and Olli-Petteri Pitkänen.

COMAP, the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, is a USA
based organization that holds annual mathematics competitions for
undergraduate level students.
